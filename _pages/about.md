"The MathQuantum RTG (Research Training Group) is a community of faculty, graduate students, postdocs, and undergraduate students using advanced mathematical tools to solve Quantum Information Science research problems. We're funded by NSF award DMS-2231533." - MathQuantum
The Mini-Project is a culminating activity that brings together everything Iâ€™ve learned during the MathQuantum program in a creative way. As an aspiring Ramsey Theorist, what better option is there than writing up about Ramsey Theory and Quantum? 
We aren't expected to finish the entire project by the end of the Program, though I will take the initative to continue to research and collaborate to have a write up and presentation by a future MathQuantum Symposium.
